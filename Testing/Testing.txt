Testing Stage of NEA development
Final Implementation is complete and now I need to find any possible bugs 

I will be testing all examples of user input and inputting: expected input, erroneous input, and edge cases

Testing Table:

  Test # | Test Name | Valid, Invalid, Edge Input | Valid, Invalid, Edge Output | Solution if needed
    / = Correct Output, X = Incorrect Output

    Test 1: parentID input stage | parent123, , n/a | /, X, /| Implemented a check if parentID exists 
    Test 2: Option choice | 2, 6, 3 | /, /, / | n/a
    Test 3: Day choice | 2, a, 3 | /, /, / | n/a
    Test 4: Time slot choice | slot5, 4, slot9 | /, X, / | Implemented a check if slot choice is a valid option
    Test 5: Choosing already taken slot | n/a, n/a, n/a | X | Implemented new function to check if slot is taken 

  These are all occurences of User input, after error checks have been implemented there are no longer any errors to be found
